I hope this letter finds you well.
 
I love your channel and look forward to all you YouTube videos.
 
This weekend I took on finding the end portal Stronghold in Minecraft
 
There are many websites that will do this for you, but I thought it would be an interesting math challenge. (geometry / trig / linear algebra / matrix math  Hits all the sweet spots)
 
One of the oddities that made this tougher for me is that Minecraft does not use a standard Cartesian coordinate system.
                                https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Coordinates
 
to summarize: In mine craft:
                North    is â€“ Z      (all of these can be +/- and from zero or under a millionâ€¦. I think)
                South    is + Z
                East        is + X
                West      is â€“ X
               
                (not useful for our discussion today)
                Up          is + Y
                Down    is â€“ Y  (. 1 is the lowest possibly value)
 
                Your heading is measures in degrees with 0 being due South.
                Degree increase positively in a clockwise direction, so
                South = 0 degrees
                West = 90 degrees
                North = +/-  180 degrees
                East â€“ 270 degrees or -90 degrees
 
Took me a while to figure out what that meant to standard trig. ðŸ˜‰
 
The technique described to find the (closest) end portal.
                                https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Eye_of_Ender#Locating_strongholds

            Throw an Eye of Ender into the air.
            It will head towards the portal no matter where you are
            Mark down your location data. And heading  (F3 for data page)
 
            Go 500 to 1000 blocks in x or z direction
            I like to pick a direction that is an axis of the quadrant my initial direction was in.  (better triangle?)
            Repeat Eye of ender again
            and get your second point
 
Now with the data, comes the math(s)         
 
            I was shocked that I never learned that
                        Tangent (in radians) =  Slope
 
            That seems like an important connection between different maths
 
            For Minecraft tangent looks a little different.
            If I am doing it right
                        Minecaft Z become standard x and Mincraft X becomes negative  y
 
            Tan(theta) =  -X / Z
 
            So solution should look like
 
            Convert each point and direction to a line ( y=mx+b,  or  x=mz+b in our case)
            M1 = - tan(Theta1)
            B1 = X1 â€“ M1*Z1
 
            (repeat for other points)
 
            Solve system of equations for pairs of lines
 
            I think I did this right.. had a sign issue, but think it is corrected (I swapped the denomerator).
 
            X = (B1*M2 â€“ B2*M1) / (M2 â€“ M1)
            Z=(B1-B2) / (M2-M1)
              
 
            Go to the spot in the world. And deep straight down (never recommendedâ€¦lol).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCsZzaFTGQ0
            If you find a brick / man-made structure you did it right.
 
 
Of course once you have an algorithm, you need to write a program. ðŸ˜‰

Improvements:
Use (the) matrix
The coordinate transformation feels like I should have been able to do it with matrix (multiplication?)
my matrix math is a little weakâ€¦.
I remember way back in college doing some similar with robot joints (kinematics?) to change the frame of refence of the joint from local to global coords.
But I would love to see how this could be applied here.
 
Measuring accuracy
            Also there is something about the angles and distance between the points that could be used as a confidence / accuracy measurement
 
            I mean if I only go 15 blocks away from the first point and get a similar angle (Minecraft only gives one decimal place for degree measure)
            This would be a lot less accurate than going hundred of blocks away and creating a triangle that is not tilted over (not sure the math term, center that is outside is base line?)
 
            Writing this outâ€¦ I am thinking the accuracy is somehow related to the size of the angle at the End portal vertex. Feels like there is a sweet spotâ€¦ not too large / not too small.
           
 
Well enough ramblingâ€¦..
 
I just thought I would share with a fellow math head
 
Thank you again for all you do and your great YouTube content
